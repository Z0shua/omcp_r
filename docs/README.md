## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

The OMCP Python Sandbox is a secure, Model Context Protocol (MCP) compliant Python code execution environment that provides isolated, containerized Python environments for safe code execution. Built with enterprise-grade security features, it enables AI agents and applications to execute Python code without compromising system security.

### Key Components

1. **FastMCP Server** (`src/omcp_py/main.py`) - Main MCP server implementation using FastMCP framework
2. **Sandbox Manager** (`src/omcp_py/sandbox_manager.py`) - Docker container lifecycle management
3. **Configuration System** (`src/omcp_py/config.py`) - Environment-based configuration management
4. **Security Layer** - Comprehensive security measures including container isolation and resource limits

### Architecture Highlights

- **Docker-based Isolation**: Each sandbox runs in a separate Docker container with enhanced security
- **MCP Compliance**: Full Model Context Protocol specification compliance
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and resource limits
- **Security First**: Network isolation, read-only filesystems, dropped capabilities
- **Healthcare Ready**: OMOP CDM integration for clinical data analysis

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fastomop/omcp_py.git
cd omcp_py
uv pip install -e .
```

### Running the Server
```bash
python src/omcp_py/main.py
```

### Using MCP Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python src/omcp_py/main.py
```
